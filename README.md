# Login or Register Page

Login page consist of a header and a form. The header will restrict access to two navigation links - 'Dashboard', 'Profile' - until user has logged in.

The page houses both the login and register view without linking to seperate pages. By clicking the 'Sign up' (Login Mode) or 'Sign in' (Register Mode) text, the login and register view will be toggled.

Should a user who is confirmed to be registered enter an incorrect password 5 times, their account will be locked. Recovery is only possible through the Forgot Password option.

Error messages will be shown, in keeping with friendly UX/UI principles to ensure users know when something has went wrong and what exactly that something is.

Once the loginOrRegister page is loaded, a login token will be checked for, which is encrypted and stored on the LocalStorage when a user clicks 'Remember me' on successful log in.

Finally, A user can login using OAuth2 for google, microsoft and apple. Any successful login will result in user being redirected to their account Dashboard.
